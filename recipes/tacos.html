<p>Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal. This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!</p>

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Dried chile peppers</b>: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
    <li><b>Beaf:</b>Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
    <li><b>seasonings:</b> You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
    </li>
    <li><b>Olive oil:</b>Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
    <li><b>tomatoes:</b>Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
    <li><b>vinegar:</b> Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
    <li><b>Tortillas:</b>Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
    <li><b>onion and cilantro</b>Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
</ul>
